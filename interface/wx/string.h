    @class wxString

    String class for passing textual data to or receiving it from wxWidgets.

    @note
    While the use of wxString is unavoidable in wxWidgets programs, you are
    encouraged to use the standard string classes @c std::string or @c
    std::wstring in your applications and convert them to and from wxString
    only when interacting with wxWidgets.


    wxString is a class representing a Unicode character string but with
    methods taking or returning both @c wchar_t wide characters and @c wchar_t*
    wide strings and traditional @c char characters and @c char* strings. The
    dual nature of wxString API makes it simple to use in all cases and,
    importantly, allows the code written for either ANSI or Unicode builds of
    the previous wxWidgets versions to compile and work correctly with the
    single unified build of wxWidgets 3.0 and later. It is also mostly
    transparent when using wxString with the few exceptions described below.


    @section string_api API overview

    wxString tries to be similar to both @c std::string and @c std::wstring and
    can mostly be used as either class. It provides practically all of the
    methods of these classes, which behave exactly the same as in the standard
    C++, and so are not documented here (please see documentation at
    https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string for this).

    In addition to these standard methods, wxString adds functions dealing with
    the conversions between different string encodings, described below, as
    well as many extra helpers such as functions for formatted output
    (Printf(), Format(), ...), case conversion (MakeUpper(), Capitalize(), ...)
    and various others (Trim(), StartsWith(), Matches(), ...). All of the
    non-standard methods follow wxWidgets "CamelCase" naming convention and are
    documented here.

    Notice that some wxString methods exist in several versions for
    compatibility reasons. For example all of length(), Length() and Len() are
    provided. In such cases it is recommended to use the standard string-like
    method, i.e. length() in this case.


    @section string_conv Converting to and from wxString

    wxString can be created from:
        - ASCII string guaranteed to contain only 7 bit characters using
        wxString::FromAscii().
        - Narrow @c char* string in the current locale encoding using implicit
        wxString::wxString(const char*) constructor or using more explicit
        wxString::wxString(const char*, const wxMBConv&) constructor passing it
        wxConvLibc as the second argument.
        - Narrow @c char* string in UTF-8 encoding using wxString::FromUTF8().
        - Narrow @c char* string in the given encoding using
        wxString::wxString(const char*, const wxMBConv&) constructor passing a
        wxCSConv corresponding to the encoding as the second argument.
        - Standard @c std::string using implicit
        wxString::wxString(const std::string&) constructor.
        Notice that this constructor supposes that the string contains data in
        the current locale encoding, use FromUTF8() if the string contains
        UTF-8-encoded data instead.
        - Standard @c std::string_view using implicit wxString::wxString(std::string_view)
        constructor.
        Notice that this constructor supposes that the string contains data in
        the current locale encoding, use FromUTF8() if the string contains
        UTF-8-encoded data instead.
        - Wide @c wchar_t* string using implicit
        wxString::wxString(const wchar_t*) constructor.
        - Standard @c std::wstring using implicit
        wxString::wxString(const std::wstring&) constructor.
        - Standard @c std::wstring_view using implicit
        wxString::wxString(std::wstring_view) constructor.

    Notice that many of the constructors are implicit, meaning that you don't
    even need to write them at all to pass the existing string to some
    wxWidgets function taking a wxString. This is convenient, but can also be
    dangerous when constructing wxString from `char*` or `std::string` if it
    doesn't have the expected encoding, as the resulting string will be empty
    if the conversion from the current locale encoding fails. If you want to
    disable all such conversions at compile-time, you may predefine
    `wxNO_IMPLICIT_WXSTRING_ENCODING` when compiling the application code and
    the corresponding conversions become inaccessible, i.e.
    @code
        wxString s;
        // s = "world"; does not compile with wxNO_IMPLICIT_WXSTRING_ENCODING
        s = wxString::FromAscii("world"); // Always compiles
        s = wxASCII_STR("world"); // shorthand for the above
        s = wxString::FromUTF8("world"); // Always compiles
        s = wxString("world", wxConvLibc); // Always compiles, explicit encoding
        s = wxASCII_STR("Grüße"); // Always compiles but s may be empty!
    @endcode

    The only case in which such conversions are fully safe is when the library
    is compiled with `wxUSE_UTF8_LOCALE_ONLY` option set to 1, as all the
    strings are assumed to be in UTF-8 encoding then.


    Similarly, wxString can be converted to:
        - ASCII string using wxString::ToAscii(). This is a potentially
        destructive operation as all non-ASCII string characters are replaced
        with a placeholder character.
        - String in the current locale encoding implicitly or using c_str() or
        mb_str() methods. This is a potentially destructive operation as an @e
        empty string is returned if the conversion fails.
        - String in UTF-8 encoding using wxString::utf8_str().
        - String in any given encoding using mb_str() with the appropriate
        wxMBConv object. This is also a potentially destructive operation.
        - Standard @c std::string using wxString::ToStdString(). The encoding
        of the returned string is specified with a wxMBConv object, so this
        conversion is potentially destructive as well. To ensure that there is
        no data loss, use @c wxConvUTF8 conversion or wxString::utf8_string().
        - Wide C string using implicit conversion or wxString::wc_str()
        explicitly.
        - Standard @c std::wstring using wxString::ToStdWstring() or its
        synonym wxString::wc_string().


    As above, defining `wxNO_IMPLICIT_WXSTRING_ENCODING` when compiling
    application code prevents the implicit use of the current locale encoding
    and disables implicit conversions to `char*` and `std::string` as well as
    using mb_str() and ToStdString() without explicitly specifying the
    encoding:
    @code
        const char *c;
        // c = s.c_str();  does not compile with wxNO_IMPLICIT_WXSTRING_ENCODING
        // c = s.mb_str(); does not compile with wxNO_IMPLICIT_WXSTRING_ENCODING
        c = s.ToAscii(); // Always compiles, encoding may fail
        c = s.ToUTF8(); // Always compiles, encoding never fails
        c = s.utf8_str(); // Alias for the above
        c = s.mb_str(wxConvLibc); // Always compiles, explicit encoding, but
                                  // conversion may fail!
    @endcode

    However, if completely disabling conversions to narrow strings by defining
    `wxNO_IMPLICIT_WXSTRING_ENCODING` is undesirable, it is also possible to
    disable implicit conversions by predefining `wxNO_UNSAFE_WXSTRING_CONV`
    instead, i.e. with this symbol defined implicit conversion to `const char*`
    becomes unavailable -- but explicit conversions using c_str() and mb_str()
    still work.

    Finally, please note that implicit conversion to both `const char*` (which
    is unsafe for the reasons explained above) and to `const wchar_t*` (which
    is safe from this point of view, but may still be considered dangerous, as
    any implicit conversion) may be entirely disabled by defining
    `wxNO_IMPLICIT_WXSTRING_CONV_TO_PTR` when building the application.


    To summarize, the safest way to use wxString is to always define
    `wxNO_IMPLICIT_WXSTRING_ENCODING` in the application compilation options to
    disable all implicit uses of encoding and specify it explicitly, typically
    by using utf8_str() or utf8_string() and FromUTF8() for conversions, for
    every operation. If this is impossible, for example because it would
    require too many changes to the existing code, consider defining
    `wxNO_UNSAFE_WXSTRING_CONV` to at least disable implicit unsafe conversions.


    @section string_gotchas Traps for the unwary

    As mentioned above, wxString tries to be compatible with both narrow and
    wide standard string classes and mostly does it transparently, but there
    are some exceptions.

    @subsection string_gotchas_element String element access

    Some problems are caused by wxString::operator[]() which returns an object
    of a special proxy class allowing to assign either a simple @c char or a @c
    wchar_t to the given index. Because of this, the return type of this
    operator is neither @c char nor @c wchar_t nor a reference to one of these
    types but wxUniCharRef which is not a primitive type and hence can't be
    used in the @c switch statement. So the following code does @e not compile
        @code
            wxString s(...);
            switch ( s[n] ) {
                case 'A':
                    ...
                    break;
            }
        @endcode
    and you need to use
        @code
            switch ( s[n].GetValue() ) {
                ...
            }
        @endcode
    instead. Alternatively, you can use an explicit cast:
        @code
            switch ( static_cast<char>(s[n]) ) {
                ...
            }
        @endcode
    but notice that this will result in an assert failure if the character at
    the given position is not representable as a single @c char in the current
    encoding, so you may want to cast to @c int instead if non-ASCII values can
    be used.

    Another consequence of this unusual return type arises when it is used with
    template deduction or C++11 @c auto keyword. Unlike with the normal
    references which are deduced to be of the referenced type, the deduced type
    for wxUniCharRef is wxUniCharRef itself. This results in potentially
    unexpected behaviour, for example:
        @code
            wxString s("abc");
            auto c = s[0];
            c = 'x';            // Modifies the string!
            wxASSERT( s == "xbc" );
        @endcode
    Due to this, either explicitly specify the variable type:
        @code
            int c = s[0];
            c = 'x';            // Doesn't modify the string any more.
            wxASSERT( s == "abc" );
        @endcode
    or explicitly convert the return value:
        @code
            auto c = s[0].GetValue();
            c = 'x';            // Doesn't modify the string either.
            wxASSERT( s == "abc" );
        @endcode


    @subsection string_gotchas_conv Conversion to C string

    A different class of problems happens due to the dual nature of the return
    value of wxString::c_str() method, which is also used for implicit
    conversions. The result of calls to this method is convertible to either
    narrow @c char* string or wide @c wchar_t* string and so, again, has
    neither the former nor the latter type. Usually, the correct type will be
    chosen depending on how you use the result but sometimes the compiler can't
    choose it because of an ambiguity, e.g.:
        @code
            // Some non-wxWidgets functions existing for both narrow and wide
            // strings:
            void dump_text(const char* text);       // Version (1)
            void dump_text(const wchar_t* text);    // Version (2)

            wxString s(...);
            dump_text(s);           // ERROR: ambiguity.
            dump_text(s.c_str());   // ERROR: still ambiguous.
        @endcode
    In this case you need to explicitly convert to the type that you need to
    use or use a different, non-ambiguous, conversion function (which is
    usually the best choice):
        @code
            dump_text(static_cast<const char*>(s));            // OK, calls (1)
            dump_text(static_cast<const wchar_t*>(s.c_str())); // OK, calls (2)
            dump_text(s.mb_str());                             // OK, calls (1)
            dump_text(s.wc_str());                             // OK, calls (2)
            dump_text(s.wx_str());                             // OK, calls ???
        @endcode

    @subsection string_vararg Using wxString with vararg functions

    A special subclass of the problems arising due to the polymorphic nature of
    wxString::c_str() result type happens when using functions taking an
    arbitrary number of arguments, such as the standard @c printf(). Due to the
    rules of the C++ language, the types for the "variable" arguments of such
    functions are not specified and hence the compiler cannot convert wxString
    objects, or the objects returned by wxString::c_str(), to these unknown
    types automatically. Hence neither wxString objects nor the results of most
    of the conversion functions can be passed as vararg arguments:
        @code
            // ALL EXAMPLES HERE DO NOT WORK, DO NOT USE THEM!
            printf("Don't do this: %s", s);
            printf("Don't do that: %s", s.c_str());
            printf("Nor even this: %s", s.mb_str());
            wprintf("And even not always this: %s", s.wc_str());
        @endcode
    Instead you need to either explicitly cast to the needed type:
        @code
            // These examples work but are not the best solution, see below.
            printf("You can do this: %s", static_cast<const char*>(s));
            printf("Or this: %s", static_cast<const char*>(s.c_str()));
            printf("And this: %s", static_cast<const char*>(s.mb_str()));
            wprintf("Or this: %s", static_cast<const wchar_t*>(s.wc_str()));
        @endcode
    But a better solution is to use wxWidgets-provided functions, if possible,
    as is the case for @c printf family of functions:
        @code
            // This is the recommended way.
            wxPrintf("You can do just this: %s", s);
            wxPrintf("And this (but it is redundant): %s", s.c_str());
            wxPrintf("And this (not using Unicode): %s", s.mb_str());
            wxPrintf("And this (always Unicode): %s", s.wc_str());
        @endcode
    Notice that wxPrintf() replaces both @c printf() and @c wprintf() and
    accepts wxString objects, results of c_str() calls but also @c char* and
    @c wchar_t* strings directly.

    wxWidgets provides wx-prefixed equivalents to all the standard vararg
    functions and a few more, notably wxString::Format(), wxLogMessage(),
    wxLogError() and other log functions. But if you can't use one of those
    functions and need to pass wxString objects to non-wx vararg functions, you
    need to use the explicit casts as explained above.


    @section string_performance Performance characteristics

    wxString uses @c std::basic_string internally to store its content and it
    therefore inherits many features from the standard class. In particular,
    most implementations of @c std::basic_string use small string optimization,
    meaning that they avoid allocating heap memory for short strings, and this
    is also true for wxString.

    By default, wxString uses @c std::basic_string specialized for the
    platform-dependent @c wchar_t type, meaning that it is not memory-efficient
    for ASCII strings, especially under Unix platforms where every ASCII
    character, normally fitting in a byte, is represented by a 4 byte @c
    wchar_t.

    It is possible to build wxWidgets with @c wxUSE_UNICODE_UTF8 set to 1 in
    which case an UTF-8-encoded string representation is stored in @c
    std::basic_string specialized for @c char, i.e. the usual @c std::string.
    In this case the memory efficiency problem mentioned above doesn't arise
    but run-time performance of many wxString methods changes dramatically, in
    particular accessing the N-th character of the string becomes an operation
    taking O(N) time instead of O(1), i.e. constant, time by default. Thus, if
    you do use this so called UTF-8 build, you should avoid using indices to
    access the strings whenever possible and use the iterators instead. As an
    example, traversing the string using iterators is an O(N), where N is the
    string length, operation in both the normal ("wchar_t") and UTF-8 builds
    but doing it using indices becomes O(N^2) in UTF-8 case meaning that simply
    checking every character of a reasonably long (e.g. a couple of millions
    elements) string can take an unreasonably long time.

    However, if you do use iterators, UTF-8 build can be a better choice than
    the default build, especially for the memory-constrained embedded systems.
    Notice also that GTK+ and DirectFB use UTF-8 internally, so using this
    build not only saves memory for ASCII strings but also avoids conversions
    between wxWidgets and the underlying toolkit.

    @class wxStringBufferLength

    This helper class allows you to conveniently access the wxString internal buffer

    For example, assuming you have a low-level OS function called
    @c "int GetMeaningOfLifeAsString(char *)" copying the value in the provided
    buffer (which must be writable, of course), and returning the actual length
    of the string, you might call it like this:

    @code
        wxString theAnswer;
        {
            wxStringBufferLength theAnswerBuffer(theAnswer, 1024);
            int nLength = GetMeaningOfLifeAsString(theAnswerBuffer);

        if ( theAnswer != "42" )
            wxLogError("Something is very wrong!");
    @endcode

    Note that the string can't be used in any way while a buffer associated
    with it exists, the buffer must be destroyed to allow using the string
    again.

    If possible, this class uses the internal wxString storage directly,
